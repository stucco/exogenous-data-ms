The vulnerability is within the ""sreplace"" function within the ""src/support.c"" file.  The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug since then.  Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'.  We were unable to reach the ""sreplace"" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them:  1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace! 2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via the ""pr_display_file"" function! 3. stupid '.message' file display bug  So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit. To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a writeable directory, then do ""CWD <writeable directory>"" to trigger the invocation of sreplace function.  Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message' file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug.

By sending data containing a large number of Telnet IAC commands, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code.  The Debian Squeeze version of the exploit uses a little ROP stub to indirectly transfer the flow of execution to a pool buffer (the cmd_rec ""res"" in ""pr_cmd_read"").  The Ubuntu version uses a ROP stager to mmap RWX memory, copy a small stub to it, and execute the stub. The stub then copies the remainder of the payload in and executes it.  NOTE: Most Linux distributions either do not ship a vulnerable version of ProFTPD, or they ship a version compiled with stack smashing protection.  Although SSP significantly reduces the probability of a single attempt succeeding, it will not prevent exploitation. Since the daemon forks in a default configuration, the cookie value will remain the same despite some attemtps failing. By making repeated requests, an attacker can eventually guess the cookie value and exploit the vulnerability.  The cookie in Ubuntu has 24-bits of entropy.

By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can corrupt the heap and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon.  The root cause is that no check is made to ensure that the buffer is not full prior to handling '%s' format specifiers within the 'string_vformat' function. In order to trigger this issue, we get our message rejected by sending a message that is too large. This will call into log_write to log rejection headers (which is a default configuration setting). After filling the buffer, a long header string is sent. In a successful attempt, it overwrites the ACL for the 'MAIL FROM' command. By sending a second message, the string we sent will be evaluated with 'expand_string' and arbitrary shell commands can be executed.  It is likely that this issue could also be exploited using other techniques such as targeting in-band heap management structures, or perhaps even function pointers stored in the heap. However, these techniques would likely be far more platform specific, more complicated, and less reliable.  This bug was original found and reported in December 2008, but was not properly handled as a security issue. Therefore, there was a 2 year lag time between when the issue was fixed and when it was discovered being exploited in the wild. At that point, the issue was assigned a CVE and began being addressed by downstream vendors.  An additional vulnerability, CVE-2010-4345, was also used in the attack that led to the discovery of danger of this bug. This bug allows a local user to gain root privileges from the Exim user account.

By calling the 'AuthCredential' method with a specially crafted Unicode format string, an attacker can cause memory corruption and execute arbitrary code.  Unfortunately, it does not appear to be possible to indirectly re-use existing stack data for more reliable exploitation. This is due to several particulars about this vulnerability. First, the format string must be a Unicode string, which uses two bytes per character. Second, the buffer is allocated on the stack using the 'alloca' function. As such, each additional format specifier (%x) will add four more bytes to the size allocated. This results in the inability to move the read pointer outside of the buffer.  Further testing showed that using specifiers that pop more than four bytes does not help. Any number of format specifiers will result in accessing the same value within the buffer.  NOTE: It may be possible to leverage the vulnerability to leak memory contents. However, that has not been fully investigated at this time.","Metasploit Framework License (BSD)","f","2010-08-19 00:00:00",0,,"passive","t","OSVDB-67286, URL-http://sotiriu.de/adv/NSOADV-2010-005.txt","Nikolas Sotiriu, jduck <jduck@metasploit.com>"

The buffer is located  on the runtime program stack.   When the WorkStation file is opened it will reach the code path at 0x67575180 located in  pcspref.dll which conducts string manipulation and validation on the data supplied in the  WorkStation file. The application will first check if 'Profile' header exists and appends  a dot with the next parameter within the file. It will then measure the character length  of the header by calling strcspn with a dot as its null-terminated character.   It will then write the header into memory and ensure the header ends with a NUL character.  The parameter character array is passed to the strcpy() function. The application has  declared a 52-element character array for the destination for strcpy function. The  function does not perform bounds checking therefore, data can be written paste the end of  the buffer variable resulting in corruption of adjacent variables including other local  variables, program state information and function arguments. You will notice that the  saved RETURN address at offset 0x6c is overwritten by the data written past the buffer.   To ensure we can perform arbitrary code execution we must we provide a valid pointer at  0x74 which is used as a argument for the called function at 0x675751ED as a id file  extension parameter.

By sending an specially crafted FTP PORT command, an attacker can corrupt stack memory and execute arbitrary code.  This particular issue is caused by processing data bound by attacker controlled input while writing into a 4 byte stack buffer. Unfortunately, the writing that occurs is not a simple byte copy.  Processing is done using a source ptr (p) and a destination pointer (q). The vulnerable function walks the input string and continues while the source byte is non-null. If a comma is encountered, the function increments the the destination pointer. If an ascii digit [0-9] is encountered, the following occurs:  *q = (*q * 10) + (*p - '0');  All other input characters are ignored in this loop.  As a consequence, an attacker must craft input such that modifications to the current values on the stack result in usable values. In this exploit, the low two bytes of the return address are adjusted to point at the location of a 'call edi' instruction within the binary. This was chosen since 'edi' points at the source buffer when the function returns.  NOTE: This server can be installed as a service using ""vftpd.exe install"".

In addition, even though this exploit can be used as remote, you should be aware the victim's browser behavior when opening an itms link. For example, IE/Firefox/Opera by default will ask the user for permission before launching the itms link by iTunes. Chrome will ask for permission, but also spits a warning. Safari would be an ideal target, because it will open the link without any user interaction.","Metasploit Framework License (BSD)","f","2012-06-21 00:00:00",,,"passive","t","EDB-19322, OSVDB-83220, URL-http://pastehtml.com/view/c25uhk4ab.html","Rh0 <rh0@z1p.biz>, sinn3r <sinn3r@metasploit.com>"

If the connecting user is an administrator and network logins are allowed to the target machine, this module will execute an arbitrary payload.

The easiest way to force a SMB authentication attempt is by embedding a UNC path (\\SERVER\SHARE) into a web page or email message.

In order to reach the vulnerable code, the target server must have an ISAPI module installed and configured.  By making a request that terminates abnormally (either an aborted TCP connection or an unsatisfied chunked request), mod_isapi will unload the ISAPI extension. Later, if another request comes for that ISAPI module, previously obtained pointers will be used resulting in an access violation or potentially arbitrary code execution.  Although arbitrary code execution is theoretically possible, a real-world method of invoking this consequence has not been proven. In order to do so, one would need to find a situation where a particular ISAPI module loads at an image base address that can be re-allocated by a remote attacker.  Limited success was encountered using two separate ISAPI modules. In this scenario, a second ISAPI module was loaded into the same memory area as the previously unloaded module.","Metasploit Framework License (BSD)","f","2010-03-05 00:00:00",,,"aggressive","t","BID-38494, CVE-2010-0425, EDB-11650, OSVDB-62674, URL-http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/apache/cvs/381537, URL-http://www.senseofsecurity.com.au/advisories/SOS-10-002, URL-https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48509","Brett Gervasoni, jduck <jduck@metasploit.com>"

The resulting value is used in several calculations and is then passed as the length value to an inline memcpy operation.
